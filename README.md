# fantasy-pkm

## NOTE

This project is being severely overhauled.

It may be replaced by another project soon.

This tool is an open-source project for creating and
hosting a "Fantasy Pokemon" league.

Included is a barebones Pokemon browser.

There are plans to add a bracketing and tracking
system for users.

The system runs off of streamlit and can be hosted in
the cloud at
[streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)

Pokemon data acquired from
[pokemondb.net](https://pokemondb.net)
