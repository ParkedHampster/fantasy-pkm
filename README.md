# fantasy-pkm

This tool is an open-source project for creating and
hosting a "Fantasy Pokemon" league.

Included is a barebones Pokemon browser.

There are plans to add a bracketing and tracking
system for users.

The system runs off of streamlit and can be hosted in
the cloud at
[streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)
